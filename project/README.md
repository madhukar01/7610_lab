# Ethereum LLM Oracle Network

A decentralized oracle network enabling Ethereum smart contracts to securely interact with Large Language Models (LLMs).

## How to run on local machine
- `config\config.json` contains the configuration and API keys
- Start the oracle
    - `cd <project root>`
    - `go build .\oracle\cmd\server\`
    - Run `server.exe --config config\config.json` or `server --config config\config.json`
    - The oracle will start listening on port 8080
- Start the listener
    - `cd <project root>`
    - `cd scripts`
    - `go run main.go`
    - The listener will start looking for events on the Polygon ZKEVM testnet
- Initiate a transaction with Prompt
    - `cd <project root>`
    - `cd scripts`
    - `go run caller.go --prompt "Tell me a short story about northeastern"`
    - The caller will initiate a transaction with the prompt and wait for the response
    - The response will be stored to IPFS and also printed to the console

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized oracle network that bridges the gap between deterministic blockchain smart contracts and non-deterministic Large Language Models. Built on the Polygon ZKEVM testnet, the system uses a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus mechanism to handle LLM outputs reliably and securely.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Oracle Network**: 7-node network with PBFT consensus
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Solidity contracts for query submission and response handling
- **IPFS Storage**: Efficient off-chain storage with on-chain hash references
- **Response Validation**: Semantic similarity scoring using cosine similarity
- **Docker Support**: Containerized oracle nodes for easy deployment
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms for node failures
